# Rollar-Madness
Welcome to Roller Madness!!!!

This game can be played by opening the Index.html(Builds->WebGL) document through Mozilla Firefox/ Microsoft Edge.
The concept for clearing the game is to collect the required of number of coins as shown on the screen. You are able to control a rollerball which can be used to collect all the coins. 
There are cube shaped objects (enemies) that will chase while you try to collect the coins. 
There is a Mini map provide to help u guide yourself and become aware of any enemies around you.
Entering the Red Coloured Zone(Death Zone) will kill the player.

The controls for the game are the general WASD/arrow keys(movement) along with Spacebar(Jump).

If the enemy touches the rollerball, the player dies.
If the enemy touches another enemy, both the enemies die.

In the First level, player needs to get 8 coins without touching the enemy to pass the level. 
In this level, the number of enemies are 4 and all the coins are stationary.
As you collect all the 8 coins, you will be promoted to the next level.

In the Second level, player needs to collect 12 coins without touching the enemy to pass the level.
In this level, 8 coins are stationary while the other 4 are released from the coin Spawners that are located at the East and West Corners of the map respectively.
The coin Spawners, spawn bouncy coins that are released from the Spawners at a random interval between 3 to 5 seconds. The coins are available for the player to collect from 10 seconds of spawning. 
After 10 seconds, the coins disapper from the map.

In this level, 4 enemies are present in the initial stages of the game and then after the enemies are spawned from the Enemy Spawners that are located in the North and the South corner of the map respectively.
There is no limit to the number of enemies, they keep spawning from the Enemy Spawners at a random interval between 3 to 5 seconds.

As you collect all the 12 coins in this level without touching the enemy, the player wins the game.

Tips: - You jump to avoid difficult situations when the enemies are nearby. Jump allows the ball to travel faster and reach the various edges of the map.
           Keep an eye on the minimap to avoid getting surrounded by enemies.
           Try to collide enemies together as much as possible to reduce the difficulty of the game.

                The Play Again button in the level 2 loads the Level 2 again.
                The Restart button in the level 2 loads the entire game again.

Have fun !!
